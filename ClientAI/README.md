Welcome to our Artificial Inteligence for our Zappy project.
The goal of our IA is to create some people that can be living on a planet,
We need to create some random element like meteorites that will spawn ressources on the planet, birth, etc...
We imagnine to have 3 types of AI:
1: Some AI just tell to the server their position.
2: Some AI just tell to the server where the ressources spawn.
3: Some AI just go and take the ressources.
Our AI need to communicate between each other.
If a person have all the ressources he need, he can level-up.
A AI can level-up 8 times.
Our AI need as well to feed himself. If he don't eat, he will die.
They have a triangle vision, they can see in front of them, on the left and on the right.
The Client AI needs to analyze the game state, which includes information about the avatar's surroundings, available resources, the presence of other avatars or obstacles, and any relevant game events. Based on this information, the AI must make intelligent decisions to determine the best course of action.
The Client AI should also be capable of communication and coordination with other avatars controlled by other players or AIs. This can involve sharing information, collaborating on tasks, or even competing for resources in a strategic manner.
